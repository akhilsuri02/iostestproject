# iostestprooject
iOS test project app


NOTES:

I have added fixes to the bugs as informed in the task.
I was not able to fix the test cases, but could review the memory issue and reviewed usage of Profiling instrument to identify memory leaks, I would require some more review time to refresh my memory on how can I use these tools to fix memory.
The issue of strong reference being released, which should have released weak reference could be seen. But the strong reference to object is being held in the code
